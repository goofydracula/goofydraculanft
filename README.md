Goofy Dracula NFT Project

Goofy Dracula is a unique, hand drawn, NFT collection centred around a goofier, more family friendly, version of Dracula that could excite both adults and the children within themselves, and focuses on utility and long term benefits for the community and it’s members.

It differentiates itself by also keeping accurate information regarding the count’s family members (that are also included in the collection), his actions and also encompasses traditional elements from his origins.

Only elements that have deep roots in the Transylvanian culture and history, combined with crypto elements were used, so that the NFT collectors and fans of the infamous count Dracula can approach this in a more enjoyable way.

The artwork was created by a local historian, cartoonist and tattoo artist and includes both Dracula’s parents, Eupraxia and Vlad “The Devil” or “The Dragon”, but also his son, Mihnea “The Evil”, and his grandfather Mircea “The Elder”.

A total of 10,000 unique NFT’s will be sold. Users will be able to get the pieces by minting on the official website (https:// www.GoofyDracula.com). Those who are able to get on the whitelist, will have at least a 24 hours advantage to get their NFT’s before the public sale starts and the mint price will be lower.
Also, there will be special benefits provided in the future to the holders that possess the artwork NFT’s.
