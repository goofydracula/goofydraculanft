**Goofy Dracula NFT Project**

Goofy Dracula is a unique, hand drawn, NFT collection centred around a goofier, more family friendly, version of Dracula that could excite both adults and the children within themselves, and focuses on utility and long term benefits for the community and it’s members.

It differentiates itself by also keeping accurate information regarding the count’s family members (that are also included in the collection), his actions and also encompasses traditional elements from his origins.

Only elements that have deep roots in the Transylvanian culture and history, combined with crypto elements were used, so that the NFT collectors and fans of the infamous count Dracula can approach this in a more enjoyable way.

The artwork was created by a local historian, cartoonist and tattoo artist and includes both Dracula’s parents, Eupraxia and Vlad “The Devil” or “The Dragon”, but also his son, Mihnea “The Evil”, and his grandfather Mircea “The Elder”.

A total of 10,000 unique NFT’s will be sold. Users will be able to get the pieces by minting on the official website (https:// www.GoofyDracula.com). Those who are able to get on the whitelist, will have at least a 24 hours advantage to get their NFT’s before the public sale starts and the mint price will be lower.
Also, there will be special benefits provided in the future to the holders that possess the artwork NFT’s.


The project started from the founders passion towards the origins and real story of count Dracula, growing up in the heart of Transylvania, and began to take shape with the
dream of bringing more attention to the Romanian and Transylvanian values, through the legend of Count Dracula. It’s also an opportunity to help the Transylvanian kids in need, raise awareness, and provide them with better tools and resources for a healthier life and access to better education, by donating a big percentage of the proceeds from the official launch and the future collections and royalties as well. This is the first original Dracula origin series, in a traditional Transylvanian style, which is deeply related
to Dracula’s real legacy. The project is scheduled to be launched on the Solana blockchain this fall, and to say the style is unique and interesting, would be an understatement.

**The Story**

This Halloween, count Dracula woke up a little late and goofy because he drank a bad batch of blood and didn't wear his mask properly either. So now all the other monsters are making fun of him and making him feel like an outcast!

His mother, Eupraxia "The Witch," was the hardest on him, and when it seemed it couldn't get any worse, his entire family exiled him from the castle! Now, he isn’t taking good care of himself all that well and everyone started to notice. Let’s face it, his goofy look and smile aren't something anyone expected from him, but there's still time to get his groove back! Let's help our dear Dracula regain his respect and reputation within his family, of the most feared and badass monster of the night!
